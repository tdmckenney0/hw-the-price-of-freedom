The Price of Freedom v3.1 Source code.
------------------------------------------

Hello Mod Developer,

This is the TPOF source code which allows TPOF to tick. Everything is self-explanitory if you are a homeworld 2 modder. If
you are confused, check this out: http://rakrent.com/rtsc/html/hwii7.htm

The terms? Well, there is none. You can do whatever you wish with this code. It is freely distributable, recompliable. Whatever you want.

The Price of Freedom story line on the other hand, is not. 

Enjoy!
