Thanks for downloading TPOF v2.4b!
Remember: This is Beta format, a lot of things are still un-programmed or incomplete. Enjoy!

1. Setup
2. Troubleshooting
3. Skybox
4. Notes



1) Setup

	Place the tpofv2.4b.big file into your (Homeworld2 install directory)/data/ folder.

	Now, open your shortcut to homeworld 2, or make one. Add after the quotes type: -mod tpofv2.4b.big 

	Example:

	Before:

	"D:\Program Files (x86)\Sierra\Homeworld2\Bin\Release\Homeworld2.exe"

	After:

	"D:\Program Files (x86)\Sierra\Homeworld2\Bin\Release\Homeworld2.exe" -mod tpofv2.4b.big 

	Enjoy!

2) Toubleshooting
	
	Mac Users: You will beed to select TPOF: Basic from the menu, you cannot run the advanced options yet. 
	PC users: You can use Basic to help solve problems. 
	
	If you experience crashing problems, try these solutions

	1) make a new profile from within TPOF
	2) add "-windowed"  to your shortcut (without quotes) (use -h and -w to adjust size EX. if your screen is 1280x1024, do "-h 1280 -w 1024" 
	    on your shortcut)
	3) use "-lowtex" on your shortcut if you experience lag "-quickload" if your very desperate. 
	4) Close all programs in the background.
	
3) Skybox's

	Skybox's have been removed. 

4. Notes

	This build removes a lot of experimental code, and some ships that do not serve a purpose. This is to aim TPOF at a more refinement, and prepare it 
	for the upcoming campaign programming. Also note, that I am looking at TPOF being feature-complete in version 2.8.
