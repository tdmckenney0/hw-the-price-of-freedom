RunTPOF.bat or its shortcut to begin playing.

Warning:

This version of TPOF is very complete asside from a few graphics modifications to ships and turrets. However the game is very playable. 
Please make sure you have upgraded your computer with some serious horsepower since you've bought homeworld 2. TPOF is designed to hog up as much resources 
homeworld 2 can give it in order to give you the best gameplay possible. TPOF is designed to create a more fluid 
dynamic enviroment while creating a simpler, yet complex game play environment. I hope you enjoy the new
enviroment and story we've spent time developing on. We are about ready to wrap this project up, and we like to
thank our fan base! We're going to write a better manual soon....

Thank you!
