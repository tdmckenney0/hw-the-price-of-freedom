On the other side of the galaxy was the DSCG, a rival to the UNCG, and has been since the year 2145, when it broke away from UNCG control. The Two factions never had contact since. The Year is now 2300, and a new Chairman will be elected to the UNCG, Emperor Alexander of the American Empire. His Plan is to take over the UNCG and erect the Empire of Humanity, which he would command for all eternity. Meanwhile, The DCSG, who has a failing empire, had found salvation.  They found Ancient Tablets referring to massive kingdom made entirely of light. However, more information and secrets lie buried behind a region not known to them, but where the current UNCG resides. With the two new Empires of the Dominion of Light and the UNCG, all hell can break loose at the drop of a pin.]],

After these entity broke away from the United Nations, they formed a new United Nations, between them, which created an entity spanning all of north and South America. Since then, it has grown more corrupt over the years, and will lead to its downfall. The UNCG works by having smaller States, which are former countries, which can work both independent, or dependent of each other. They are controlled by a council made up of one house, and is controlled by a state every 4 years. Meaning each country has total control for four years. With Supreme domination over the region, the UNCG is considered a hyperpower.]],

The DSCG was formed shortly after the UNCG, and was the second hyperpower on Earth at its peak.

The 22nd American Devision of the UNCG Guard was dispatched, and when they got to the place known as “The Bad Lands”, They found tons of wreckage, along with a DOL fleet.

		universeText = [[Slipstreams are corridors through higher-dimensional space. These dimensions are extremely small according to us, however, the upper realms are just as large as the universe in their geometry. Slipstreams work by having ships follow in the wake of small particles tunneling through these upper levels of space. Basically, its like surfing a wave. These particles are created by super-exciting a material named Valencium, named after the first American Empress. The material is made up of a variety of materials, and is usually found around stars with a very high level of UV and Gamma radiation. The wake of these particles are no bigger than the thickness of a sheet of paper, and act like a straw. As the particles move forward, the ship is drawn behind the particles in the wake, and ships cannot leave this wake unless power is cut to the drive. This is dangerous, and why slipgates are favored.]],

These gates are approximately 57.8 Kilometers in diameter, and are usually found in the middle of space. It is extremely rare to find them orbiting a planet, or a star for that matter.  These gates utilize slipstreams in a way that humans have yet to comprehend. One can open a gate, by inputing the coordinates of another gate in, and enter the resulting slipstream. However, this is not simple, as one must manipulate the inner 3 rings to match the location according to the galactic plain. One must have a complete understanding of physics and geometry to do so. However, the advantage is instant translocation to anywhere in the galaxy. Humanity has only plotted 159 gates, all in the Perseus arm, and part of the Scutum-Centaurus arm.]],

The location of the Hammer, is entirely unknown. However, the dol think that the hammer would lead them to salvation, but if they activate the hammer, they will destroy the universe, not open the gates to heaven!
