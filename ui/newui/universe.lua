On the other side of the galaxy was the DSCG, a rival to the UNCG, and has been since the year 2145, when it broke away from UNCG control. The Two factions never had contact since. The Year is now 2300, and a new Chairman will be elected to the UNCG, Emperor Alexander of the American Empire. His Plan is to take over the UNCG and erect the Empire of Humanity, which he would command for all eternity. Meanwhile, The DCSG, who has a failing empire, had found salvation.  They found Ancient Tablets referring to massive kingdom made entirely of light. However, more information and secrets lie buried behind a region not known to them, but where the current UNCG resides. With the two new Empires of the Dominion of Light and the UNCG,  all hell can break loose at the drop of a pin.]],
